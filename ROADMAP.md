# Roadmap â€“ IVUS ANALYSIS

## Phase 1: Load in Data and bring in usable format
- [x] Load global data
- [x] Load individual pressure and ivus data combine in class object
- [] Fix bugs in Loess data

## Phase 2: Global statistics
- [] Plot pressure change FFR, PdPa, systolic ratio
- [] Correlate pressure change with lumen change
- [] Find Lumen changes that can predict relevant pressure change

## Phase 3: Patient statistics
- [ ] Changes over intramural course, using PCA
- [ ] Find regions of highest compression
- [ ] Find predictors for FFRDobutamine <= 0.8 in regional data
