# Roadmap â€“ IVUS ANALYSIS

## Phase 1: Load in Data and bring in usable format
- [x] Load global data
- [x] Load individual pressure and ivus data combine in class object
- [] Fix bugs in Loess data

## Phase 2: Global statistics
- [x] Plot pressure change FFR, PdPa, systolic ratio  (Change FFR, iFR)
- [x] Plot lumen change, maximal lumen narrowing change
- [x] Table rest versus stress
- [x] Table iFR>0.8 versus iFR<=0.8 and FFR>0.8 versus FFR<=0.8
- [] Correlate pressure change with lumen change
- [x] All IVUS measurements as predictors for FFR<=0.8
- [x] All IVUS measurements as predictors for iFR<=0.8

## Phase 3: Patient statistics
- [] Quantify dynamics for pulsatile/stress-induced lumen changes
- [] Where most dynamics?
- [] Pulsatile as predictor for FFR/iFR <=0.8
- [] Pulsatile in combination with anatomical for prediction
- [] Vessels with more dynamic more often relevant?
